# Analysis
## Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?<br>
The target variable is called is_successful
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?<br>
All of the columns except name and ein were considered features in this model.
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? <br>
The only data removed from the model was name and ein.
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### First Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model? <br>
12 and 6 neurons, 2 hidden layers, and activation function relu

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? <br>
![Image](Deep-Learning-Challenge/Images/Results1.png)
No i achieved 72.36% not the desired 75%
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? <br>
For the first model I changed the bins from 500 to 1000 and the other from 1000 to 2000 and then I tested with the same neurons and layers as the original code.

#### Second Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model? <br>
10, 8, and 6 neurons, 3 hidden layers, and activation function relu

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? <br>
![Image](Deep-Learning-Challenge/Images/Results2.png)
No i achieved 47.08% not the desired 75%
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? <br>
For this model I added an extra hidden layer and changed the neurons on the first to layers.

#### Third Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model? <br>
16, 12, and 8 neurons, 3 hidden layers, and activation function relu

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? <br>
![Image](Deep-Learning-Challenge/Images/Results2.png)
No i achieved 72.77% not the desired 75%
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? <br>
For this model I kept it the same as the second one but this time I added more neurons
